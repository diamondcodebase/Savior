Welcome to my game "Savior". This cool game was built using the Flask web framework - a powerful and flexible Python-based tool for creating web applications. 
I hosted it on PythonAnywhere, which is an awesome choice for Python projects. It's especially great for beginners or folks on a budget, since you get one free web app per account. 
The platform also has a really user-friendly web interface and supports Flask right out of the box.

I've been watching Tim's youtube videos to pick up the fundamentals of Flask, and then I found this super helpful article from Kumar Vishal on deploying to PythonAnywhere. 
Their step-by-step instructions and guidance have been invaluable.

I'm really grateful to have gained all this new technical knowledge - it's stuff I didn't have much exposure to before, but it's been eye-opening. Hope you enjoy the game
